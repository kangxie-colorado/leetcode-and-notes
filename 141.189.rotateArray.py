as many solutions as I can?

okay.. first thing coming to mind is save a buffer then swap
there probably will be some clever tricks... after the first one

not swap both ways i<-->j.. swap forward... i->i+k-->i+k+k
each time swap one position then k times.. Â O(n*k) k is k%n

this of course TLE

then I see actually you can just swap forward N times.. it will naturally form a cycle
so same trick I can use but without k times

different cycles...
then the algorithm needs some refining.

examples show when n%k==0, there will be n/k cycles.. otherwise, only one cycle
is that true?

let me find out

I didn't use a lot of memory.. but speed is not fastest
I think there might be another solution..

the rotate by reverse is pure evil but genius
