1. for no good reason, let us begin spending one hour on solving leetcode problems 
2. let's not be picky on the time, and aim to do this in normal energy time, not the peaking time where the mind would be most focused
    2.1 because what might come your way may not be ideal 
    2.2 taking a short break before this is allowed

3. solve a problem
    3.1 always think hard
    3.2 if there is an obvious solution, do it 
    3.3 if not, think transferring it
    3.4 for each think, time box it 
    3.5 think a 2nd solution

4. spend 1hr top every day... don't go over it

5. write some pseudo-code if you can
    5.1 a big mistake is diving into coding too early, because that will end up with frenzy debuggin
    5.2 spend as much as possible time in design/think/pseudo-coding
